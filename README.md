Nathnael Mekonnen and Jonathan Debebe designed and developed this bot in 2021. The bot works on the Telegram platform, and its function is to sort, organize and display scanned notifications from a bulletin board or any picture input. The notifications are categorized as jobs, events, new products, Lottery, Brouchers, Social gatherings, wanted notices, and parades in the Menu. So, the users can choose their notifications based on their interests. It saves the time that we waste looking on public bulletin boards. Also, users don't have to subscribe to any annoying notification sent via email. On top of that, the brands and notifiers can reach their audience so precisely.

This bot has been awarded a seed fund of $2000 by the business contest held recently by Indian University, Ivy league community, and Bahir Dar university in Ethiopia.
